* SootTutorial
Minimal Setup to build an analysis using soot

** Download Soot jars and source from
   https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/soot-oss/soot/4.3.0/.

** Export the CLASSPATH
   export CLASSPATH=".:<absolute path to soot-4.3.0-with-deps.jar>"
    + Note also using the full jar name at the end,
      <path>/soot-4.3.0-with-deps.jar
    + You can also create a softlink using *ln -S <path_to_soot_jar>
      .* and then do *export CLASSPATH=".:./soot-4.3.0-with-deps.jar"*

** Export jdk location as PATH
   export PATH=<absolute path to jdk-11.0.21+9/bin>:$PATH

** Compile all the java files
   javac *.java


** Run the Analysis file
   java Analysis


** If you wish to just use soot from commandline
   + export the classpath as suggested earlier and then run
     *java soot.Main -pp -cp . -f jimple Test*.

   + The command tries to generate jimple files for the Test.class
     file in sootOutput directory.

   + cat ./sootOutput/Test.jimple to view file
